Notes about visualizations:
[[[[[[[[[[[
list the mark and channels for the figure, and discuss why you choose 
this type of visualization. If you have include color or interaction in 
the figure, you need to explain why including these can benefit the 
visualization (Any additional information you bring to the visualization).

Check your year variable, in vis1 you treat it as a categorical variable 
and in vis2 you treat it as numerical. I will prefer the numerical one. A 
small point in the source of CO2 plot, you see that sharp drop in 2020 and 
2008, due to Covid and economic crisis (I think). Think about to sort the bar 
plot, by values.

Change to another color map, a sequential one. Good to have the feature 
choices. Make sure you have clear instruction and explanation for the data 
visualization. Adjust the paragraph position. Right now it has a huge space 
between the paragraph and figure. In general, I think you have done a lot of 
comparison between GDP and CO2 emission. Can you just do a scatter plot between 
this two and allow people to filter on different year/source. I prefer to see 
different type of interactions instead of only two similar maps.

You may need to make the fonts larger and make the contrasts between the color 
stronger. Avoid the word static/interactive in the title.
