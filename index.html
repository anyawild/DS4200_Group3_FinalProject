        Throughout the past decades, the topic of global climate change and what can be done
        about it has become one of the most commonly contested topics in the world. Few indicators
        for climate change are more commonly used and studied than the amount of carbon emissions 
        produced by a given source. Because carbon emissions are such a well correlated indicator 
        for the rapidly changing global climate, it is extremely important to examine where these 
        emissions are coming from and what can be done in order to ensure that they are controlled 
        in the future. Many plans have been put forward for various countries about how to deal with 
        carbon emissions in order to slow down the effects of climate change, and oftentimes, the 
        central question for these plans is about what effect they’ll have on the given country’s 
        economy. For this reason, it is also worth examining how the economies of various countries
        have been affected in relation to their emissions status. In order to do this, it would only 
        make sense to take a closer look at the most prominent indicator of a country’s economy, 
        which is its GDP. By examining these topics and indicators in relation to each other, the 
        goal would be to gain a better understanding of global trends in emissions, and to identify 
        points in which the most optimization is needed.

        Our dataset is a simplified version of the ‘Data on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions’
        dataset maintained by Our World in Data (OWID). This larger dataset is updated regularly to 
        include metrics about global CO2 emissions, and information about it was obtained from GitHub 
        <a href='https://github.com/owid/co2-data/blob/master/README.md'>(link)</a>. To produce our final 
        dataset, we downloaded the OWID dataset, filtered for relevant columns, and removed rows with 
        years before 1990. This work was done in a Jupyter Notebook file and produced a CSV with attributes 
        about each country (name, abbreviation, population, GDP) and its CO2 emissions (without land-use 
        change (LUC) emissions, with LUC, per capita, per GDP, per unit of energy, as well as split by 
        each industry) from 1990-2022.

        These side by side line plots show the trends of both CO2 emissions and GDP in the years
        since 2000, divided by continent. Displaying the plots side by side allows us to see whether or not there
        is a pattern shared by these attributes, or a connection between them. As we can
        see, there is a clear matching trend of increasing CO2 and increasing GDP over these years, with Asia
        having the most obvious upward trend. We can also see how, in general, continents with countries of 
        higher GDPs have higher CO2 emissions.

        <img src="static2_final.png"><br>
        This overlapping line plot shows the trends of each source of global CO2 emissions 
        in the years since 2000. Comparing these lines allows us to see whether or not there are common
        trends between the industries. As evidenced by this plot, the coal industry has been the highest producer 
        of emissions, followed by oil and then gas. In comparison, the cement and flaring industries have been
        relatively lower producers of CO2 globally. Interestingly, there are sharp drops in coal and oil emissions in 2020,
        as well as in coal in 2008. These could be attributable to the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 Covid pandemic,
        respectively. Overall, we can see that CO2 emissions in <i>none</i> of these industries have experienced long-lasting decreases.

        <p>
            This bar plot shows how total CO2 emissions compare when split individually
            by industry. Importantly, we can see that the two biggest contributing industries are coal and oil,
            with the next biggest being gas. All three of these industries are considered fossil fuel industries,
            and thus, this graph indicates that an important way to lower CO2 emissions could be to decrease 
            production of fossil fuels. Also, it is interesting to note that the fourth biggest contributor of CO2
            emissions is 'Land Use Change', or the process through which land is utilized or transformed.

        <b style="font-size: 130%">Final Conclusions:</b><br><br>
        From these visualizations and analysis, there are a variety of conclusions we can come to about global emissions trends and GDP growth trends. 
        From the first static visualization, it is clear that overall CO2 emissions and global GDP growth have been on a very similar trajectory in recent 
        years, indicating a strong correlation between higher GDP and higher overall CO2 emissions. In terms of the source of these CO2 emissions, from the 
        other two static visualizations it can be observed that fossil fuels have accounted for much of the overall CO2 emissions, with little sign of slowing 
        down in scale as of 2022. From the world maps, it can be seen that the countries most responsible for the highest CO2 emissions are developed, high GDP 
        countries such as the United States and China, as well as countries heavily involved/dependent on fossil fuel production such as Saudi Arabia and the 
        United Arab Emirates. In terms of future action using this data, the clear conclusion is that to make real progress in reducing global emissions, the 
        most important component would be encouraging the countries highest in fossil fuel consumption or production to transition to other forms of energy 
        production and usage, because continuing reliance on fossil fuels for energy will only contribute to the same unsustainable trends of skyrocketing CO2 
        emissions, which has been proved to lead to worsening climate change. There are a few limitations to this analysis, as because the data is on such a
        large scale there are some nuances about the emissions and GDP data across different countries that could lead to a better understanding that are missed
        with such a broad analysis. There could also be some outliers present in the data in terms of emissions and GDP (major events such as wars, ecological
        disasters or economic crashes) that could skew the data for certain countries in certain years.
