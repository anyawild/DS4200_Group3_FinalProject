    <h1>Climate Change: Global Emissions and Economies</h1>

        <b>Introduction:</b><br><br>
        Throughout the past decades, the topic of global climate change and what can be done
        about it has become one of the most commonly contested topics in the world. Few indicators
        for climate change are more commonly used and studied than the amount of carbon emissions 
        produced by a given source. Because carbon emissions are such a well correlated indicator 
        for the rapidly changing global climate, it is extremely important to examine where these 
        emissions are coming from and what can be done in order to ensure that they are controlled 
        in the future. Many plans have been put forward for various countries about how to deal with 
        carbon emissions in order to slow down the effects of climate change, and oftentimes, the 
        central question for these plans is about what effect they’ll have on the given country’s 
        economy. For this reason, it is also worth examining how the economies of various countries
        have been affected in relation to their emissions status. In order to do this, it would only 
        make sense to take a closer look at the most prominent indicator of a country’s economy, 
        which is its GDP. By examining these topics and indicators in relation to each other, the 
        goal would be to gain a better understanding of global trends in emissions, and to identify 
        points in which the most optimization is needed.

        <b>About Our Data:</b><br><br>
        Our dataset is a simplified version of the ‘Data on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions’
        dataset maintained by Our World in Data (OWID). This larger dataset is updated regularly to 
        include metrics about global CO2 emissions, and information about it was obtained from GitHub 
        <a href='https://github.com/owid/co2-data/blob/master/README.md'>(link)</a>. To produce our final 
        dataset, we downloaded the OWID dataset, filtered for relevant columns, and removed rows with 
        years before 1990. This work was done in a Jupyter Notebook file and produced a CSV with attributes 
        about each country (name, abbreviation, population, GDP) and its CO2 emissions (without land-use 
        change (LUC) emissions, with LUC, per capita, per GDP, per unit of energy, as well as split by 
        each industry) from 1990-2022.

        This side by side static visualization shows the trends of both CO2 emissions and GDP in the years
        since 2000, divided by continent. Displaying them side by side allows us to see whether or not there
        is a pattern shared by these plots, in order to find a connection between these attributes. As we can
        see, there is a clear matching trend of increasing CO2 and increasing GDP over these years, with Asia
        having the most obvious upward trend. We can also see how, in general, continents with countries of 
        higher GDPs have higher CO2 emissions.
