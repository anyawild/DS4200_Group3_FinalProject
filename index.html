    <h1>Climate Change: Global Emissions and Economies</h1>

    <p>
        Throughout the past decades, the topic of global climate change and what can be done
        about it has become one of the most commonly contested topics in the world. Few indicators
        for climate change are more commonly used and studied than the amount of carbon emissions 
        produced by a given source. Because carbon emissions are such a well correlated indicator 
        for the rapidly changing global climate, it is extremely important to examine where these 
        emissions are coming from and what can be done in order to ensure that they are controlled 
        in the future. Many plans have been put forward for various countries about how to deal with 
        carbon emissions in order to slow down the effects of climate change, and oftentimes, the 
        central question for these plans is about what effect they’ll have on the given country’s 
        economy. For this reason, it is also worth examining how the economies of various countries
        have been affected in relation to their emissions status. In order to do this, it would only 
        make sense to take a closer look at the most prominent indicator of a country’s economy, 
        which is its GDP. By examining these topics and indicators in relation to each other, the 
        goal would be to gain a better understanding of global trends in emissions, and to identify 
        points in which the most optimization is needed.
