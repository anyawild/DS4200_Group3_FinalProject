            This visualization is an interactive worldmap showing CO2 emissions from a variety of different industries and by different metrics 
        for every country of the word over the years from 1990 to 2022. The user is able to hover over any given country to get its name, abbreviated
        ISO code, and selected emissions criteria for the selected year. In terms of year selection, the user has a choice between dragging the slider
        to the year they wish to examine, or they can press the play button to activate an animation that automatically shifts through each year.
