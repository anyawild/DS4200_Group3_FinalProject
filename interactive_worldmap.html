            This visualization is an interactive worldmap showing CO2 emissions from a variety of different industries and by different metrics 
        for every country of the world over the years from 1990 to 2022. First, the user can select a given metric or industry from the dropdown,
        which will automatically update the map to reflect the data for each country concerning the selected metric or industry. In terms of year selection, 
        the user has a choice between dragging the slider below the map to the year they wish to examine, or they can press the play button next to the year 
        scale to activate an animation that automatically shifts through each year. The user is then able to hover over any given country to get its name, 
        abbreviated ISO code, and selected criteria for the selected year. The purpose of this visualization is to give the user a better understanding of not 
        only how the different countries are doing on a large scale in relation to emissions, but also to better understand what countries are doing that produces these emissions. 
        Using this map, a user can get a good idea of any country's industrial statuses (which countries produce the most/least emissions in a certain industry, for example) 
        as well as the proportionality of a country's emissions to their other metrics (whether a country's amount of CO2 emissions is proportionate to their 
        population or GDP, for example).
